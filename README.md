# PepsiCo Data Science Challenge

## Summary

This repository contains my solution to the PepsiCo Data Science Challenge 2020. The dataset and objective was made available on September 25th, 2020, and challengers had until 
October 7th 2020 to submit their solution. The Grand Prize winner received a PepsiCo R&D internship for the summer of 2021. I was chosen as a finalist for the competition, and was
given the opportunity to present my solution to a panel of judges. The background and challenge objective are described below, taken directly from the challenge website at https://www.nyas.org/challenges/pepsico-challenge/?utm_source=PepsiCo+Data+Challenge+2020&utm_campaign=f8b6f08078-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2020_09_24_08_56&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_0568b79be0-f8b6f08078-331280438.


Background: Cereal based products rely on raw grain from crops grown by farmers. Different growing locations and environmental conditions are known to influence grain physical and 
compositional elements which can affect processing and final product quality. The goal of this exercise is to create a model that can predict the effect of growing location, soil
type, fertilizer, and crop parameters associated with growth and development on product assessment.

Challenge: A model predicting the assessment score would allow growers to assess product quality. Given the provided datasets, derive a model that would predict the assessment 
scores as accurately as possible using relevant features or predictor variables.
